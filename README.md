# Census-Record-Marriage-Model-Analysis
Data processing and record linkage pipeline for a project analyzing Taiwan’s marriage market. Using anonymized Census data, this repository implements probabilistic matching to prepare data for the transferable-utility marriage model (Choo &amp; Siow, 2006). The wider study examines age assortative mating and systematic net gains to marriage.
